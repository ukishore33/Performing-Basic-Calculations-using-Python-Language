# Performing Basic Calculculations using Python Language

The main aim of the project was to perform basic calculations on mathematical functions, statistical functions,etc

The Basic Calculation was performed using Data Structures like lists, dictionary,etc., while using functions like Print, Output, sum, avg, max, etc., and using Loops like 'for loop' and 'while loop' wherever necessary. 

The Analysis was performed to find out the necessary problems asked in this project to obtain final result 

The Questions asked in this project are in the pdf file attached below
